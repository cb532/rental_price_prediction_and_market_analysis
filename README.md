A comprehensive analysis of rental prices across the U.S. using a dataset of 10,000 apartment listings. Built predictive models for rent prices using geographic factors (state, city, latitude, longitude) and amenities. Employed linear regression, polynomial regression, and XGBoost to predict prices, with an R-squared score of 0.71. Visualized market trends using k-means clustering for price-based clusters and explored the influence of amenities on rent.
